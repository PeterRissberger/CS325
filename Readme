When calling Linear-time with Python, use, as a parameter, a number <= 0 to use the arrays from MSS_Problems.txt. Use numbers > 0 to create 10 random arrays of the same size as the number entered.

For the other programs, no arguments are required.

To compile all programs, and return their found values to MSS_Results.txt, use the makefile by entering "make makefile".
